# hw14 Testing 2

## Test types

| Type | Purpose | Scope | When |
|------|---------|-------|------|
| **Unit Testing** | To validate that individual units of code (usually functions or methods) work as expected. | Focuses on the smallest testable parts of an application (e.g., functions, classes). | During the development phase, typically the first level of testing. |
| **Functional Testing** | To validate that the software behaves according to the defined functional requirements. | Focuses on individual features or functions of the system. | After unit testing, during the system testing phase. |
| **Integration Testing** | To verify that different modules or services within an application work well together. | Focuses on the interaction between components or systems. | After unit testing but before system testing. |
| **Regression Testing** | To ensure that recent code changes have not negatively affected the existing functionality. | Retests the system to check for unexpected behavior in unchanged areas. | After fixes, updates, or enhancements are made. |
| **Smoke Testing** | To quickly verify that the basic, critical functionalities of an application are working. | A broad, shallow testing approach to cover the core functionality. | Performed on every new build before more in-depth testing. |
| **Performance Testing** | To determine the speed, responsiveness, and stability of the system under various conditions. | Tests the performance metrics (load time, throughput, etc.) under normal and peak conditions. | After functional testing, before deployment. |
| **A/B Testing** | To compare two or more versions of a feature to see which performs better in real-world usage. | Focuses on different versions or variants of a feature in the live environment. | During the product experimentation phase, often in live production environments. |
| **User Acceptance Testing** | To verify that the system meets the business needs and is ready for deployment. | End-to-end testing from a user perspective, based on real-world scenarios. | Before releasing the product to production. |

## Environment related

- **Development** Environment: This is where developers write, test, and debug code. It is used for active development of features and bug fixes.
- **QA (Quality Assurance)** Environment: This environment is used by testers (QA engineers) to validate that the software functions as expected. It is dedicated to thorough testing, such as functional, integration, regression, and performance testing.
- **Pre-prod/Staging** Environment: The staging or pre-production environment is a near-exact replica of the production environment. Its goal is to validate that the software works as expected in an environment as close to production as possible.
- **Production** Environment: This is the live environment where the end-users interact with the application. The primary goal here is to ensure system stability, performance, and reliability.
