# Homework Answers

### 1. Testing related:

**1.1. Unit Testing**  
Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions of a software application in isolation to ensure that each part functions as expected. Example: Testing a single function in a module without any external dependencies.

**1.2. Functional Testing**  
Functional testing is focused on verifying that the software functions as expected from the user's perspective. This type of testing checks whether the software performs according to its requirements. Example: Testing the login functionality of a web application.

**1.3. Integration Testing**  
Integration testing checks the interaction between different modules or components of a system to ensure they work together properly. Example: Testing the communication between a user authentication module and the database.

**1.4. Regression Testing**  
Regression testing is performed to ensure that recent changes or additions to the software haven't introduced new bugs. Example: Running a suite of tests after a feature update to verify no existing functionality is broken.

**1.5. Smoke Testing**  
Smoke testing is a preliminary test that checks whether the major functionalities of a software build are working. Example: Running a quick check on the core features of an application after a new build is deployed.

**1.6. Performance Testing**  
Performance testing assesses the speed, responsiveness, and stability of a system under a particular workload. Example: Testing how many concurrent users an application can handle before it starts to slow down.

**1.7. A/B Testing**  
A/B testing compares two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better. Example: Comparing two different versions of a website's landing page to see which one converts more visitors into customers.

**1.8. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**  
User acceptance testing is performed by the end users or clients to verify that the software meets their expectations and requirements. Example: A client tests a newly built e-commerce site to ensure it works according to their specifications.

### 2. Environment related:

**2.1. Development**  
The development environment is where developers write and test their code. It’s an isolated setup that allows developers to work without affecting the live environment. Example: A local machine with all necessary tools for writing and testing code.

**2.2. QA (Quality Assurance)**  
The QA environment is used by testers to ensure that the code works as expected before it moves to production. It mimics the production environment but is separate from it. Example: Running automated and manual tests on a replica of the production environment.

**2.3. Pre-prod/Staging**  
The staging environment is a pre-production environment that closely resembles the production environment. It is the final stage of testing before the software is deployed to production. Example: Deploying the final code to the staging environment to ensure it works as intended under production-like conditions.

**2.4. Production**  
The production environment is the live system where the end users interact with the software. Changes here are carefully controlled to avoid disruptions. Example: The live version of a web application where users perform their daily tasks.

### 3. Unit test using Junit and PowerMock

Here’s a sample unit test using JUnit and PowerMock for the static HTTP client method:

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
import org.junit.Before;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.mockito.InjectMocks;
import org.mockito.Mock;
import org.powermock.api.mockito.PowerMockito;
import org.powermock.core.classloader.annotations.PrepareForTest;
import org.powermock.modules.junit4.PowerMockRunner;

@RunWith(PowerMockRunner.class)
@PrepareForTest({HttpClient.class})
public class HttpClientTest {

    @Mock
    private HttpClient httpClient;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        PowerMockito.mockStatic(HttpClient.class);
    }

    @Test
    public void testHttpClient() throws Exception {
        // Mock response
        String mockResponse = "Mock response from API";
        
        // Stub static method
        when(HttpClient.get("https://api.github.com/users/testuser/repos?page=1")).thenReturn(mockResponse);

        // Call the method under test
        String response = HttpClient.get("https://api.github.com/users/testuser/repos?page=1");

        // Verify the response
        assertEquals("Mock response from API", response);

        // Verify the method was called
        PowerMockito.verifyStatic(HttpClient.class);
        HttpClient.get("https://api.github.com/users/testuser/repos?page=1");
    }
}
```
