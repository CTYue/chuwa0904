# Markdown Tutorial

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax. It's designed to be easy to read and write. Let's go through the basic syntax and some common features of Markdown.

## 1. Headings

Use `#` for headings. More `#` symbols create smaller headings.

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

## 2. Emphasis

You can italicize or bold text using `*`, `_`, or `**`:

*Italic* or _Italic_

**Bold** or __Bold__

***Bold and Italic*** or ___Bold and Italic___

## 3. Lists

There are two types of lists: ordered and unordered.

### Unordered List

Use `-`, `*`, or `+` for bullet points:

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2

* Item 3

### Ordered List

Use numbers followed by periods:

1. First
2. Second
   1. Sub-item
   2. Sub-item
3. Third

## 4. Links

To create a link, enclose the link text in square brackets `[]`, followed by the URL in parentheses `()`:

[OpenAI](https://openai.com)

## 5. Images

Insert images similar to links, but add an exclamation mark `!` before the square brackets:

---

## 6. Blockquotes

To create a blockquote, start the line with a `>` symbol:

> This is a blockquote.

---

## 7. Code Blocks

Inline code is enclosed with backticks `` ` ``:

This is `inline code`.

To create a multi-line code block, use three backticks \`\`\` or indent the lines with four spaces:

```python def function(): return "Hello, World!" ```

## 8. Tables

Tables are created with pipes `|` and dashes `-` for the header:


| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     |

---

## 9. Horizontal Line

Create a horizontal line using three dashes `---`, asterisks `***`, or underscores `___`:

You can create task lists with `- [ ]` for unchecked and `- [x]` for checked items:

- [X]  Task 1
- [ ]  Task 2
- [ ]  Task 3
