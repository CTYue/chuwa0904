## HW12
### Question 1
1. Setup:  JUnit provides class level setup (@BeforeAll) and method level setup (@BeforeEach) for setup
   * @BeforeAll: set up expensive resources shared by all tests。
   * @BeforeEach：set up any conditions or initialize variables specific to the individual test case.
2. Test Execution：
   * @BeforeAll：Runs once before all test methods in the current class. It's typically used to set up expensive resources shared by all tests (e.g., starting a database or initializing a test server).
   * @BeforeEach: Runs before each individual test method. It is often used to set up any conditions or initialize variables specific to the individual test case.
   * @Test：The actual test method will annotated with @Test.
3. CleanUp
   * @AfterEach: Runs after each individual test method. It’s used to clean up resources or reset states that were set up in @BeforeEach. For example, closing a file or resetting a mock object.
   * @AfterAll: Runs once after all the tests in the current class are executed. It’s typically used to clean up shared resources created in @BeforeAll.

### Question 2
Parameterized testing in JUnit allows you to run the same test repeatedly with different sets of input data. They are supported through the @ParameterizedTest annotation.
JUnit provides several argument sources to supply input values for parameterized tests. Common ones include:
* @ValueSource: Provides an array of literals (e.g., ints, strings, etc.).
* @CsvSource: Allows you to provide comma-separated values.
* @CsvFileSource: Reads input from a CSV file.
* @MethodSource: Uses a method to supply arguments.
* @EnumSource: Supplies values from an enum type.
