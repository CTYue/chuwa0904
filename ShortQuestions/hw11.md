## HW11
### Question 2
* SSL/TLS: TLS is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over a computer network. It is the successor of SSL
* PKI: It is a framework for creating, managing, distributing, using, storing, and revoking digital certificates and public-private key pairs. 
* Certificate: A certificate is a digital document that uses a digital signature to bind a public key with an entity’s identity. Certificates are issued by trusted third-party Certificate Authorities (CAs) and provide proof that the public key contained in the certificate belongs to the entity.
  * A typical certificate includes:
        * Subject: The entity to whom the certificate is issued.
        * Public Key: The public key associated with the entity.
        * Issuer: The Certificate Authority (CA) that issued the certificate.
        * Validity Period: The start and end dates during which the certificate is valid.
        * Signature: A digital signature from the CA that vouches for the authenticity of the certificate.
  
* Public Key: A public key is one half of a cryptographic key pair used in asymmetric encryption. It is used for encryption and can be shared publicly. The public key is usually embedded in a digital certificate and is used to encrypt data and verify digital signatures.
* Private Key: A private key is the other half of the cryptographic key pair used in asymmetric encryption. It must be kept secure and is never shared with others. The private key is used to decrypt data and create digital signatures.
* Signature: A digital signature is a cryptographic technique used to ensure the authenticity and integrity of a message or document. It proves that the message was created by the claimed sender (authentication) and that the message has not been altered (integrity).
    * Here's how it works:
      * The sender creates a hash (a fixed-size unique representation) of the message.
      * The sender encrypts this hash with their private key, creating the digital signature.
      * The recipient, who has the sender’s public key, can decrypt the signature and compare the result to the hash of the message.
      * If they match, the recipient knows the message is authentic and unchanged.
      * If they don't match, it means either the message has been tampered with, or the sender is not who they claim to be.

### Question 4
1. 401 Unauthorized: The client is not authenticated, meaning the request requires user authentication, and the user’s credentials are either missing or invalid.
2. 403 Forbidden: The client is authenticated but does not have permission to access the requested resource. The server understands the request, but it refuses to authorize it.
3. 419 Authentication Timeout: The authentication process has timed out, typically due to a session expiring.
4. 429 Too Many Requests: The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time, often related to authentication attempts.
5. 498 Invalid Token: An invalid or expired token was provided.
