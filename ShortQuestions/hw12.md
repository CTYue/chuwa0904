## 1. List all of the annotations you learned from class and homework to annotations.md
- @Aspect
- @Pointcut
- @Before
- @After
- @AfterReturning
- @AfterThrowing
- @Around
## 2.Briefly read Spring AOP Interview Questions

## 3. What is Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)? Explain it with detailed use cases.
- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
  - Aspect-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that allows separating cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, security, and transaction management, from business logic. Instead of embedding such concerns in the core logic of the application, AOP allows them to be defined separately.
  - r. With AOP, logging can be handled as an aspect that intercepts method calls and executes before or after the method runs.

## 4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Spring AOP?
- Advantages:
  - Modularity: Separation of cross-cutting concerns into aspects improves code maintainability.
  - Reusability: Aspects can be reused across different parts of the application.
  - Cleaner Code: It reduces clutter by removing boilerplate code like logging, security checks.

- Disvantages:
  - Complex Debugging: The code flow can become harder to trace because of invisible cross-cutting concerns.
  - Overhead: AOP introduces some performance overhead due to proxies and reflection.

## 5. Explain the following concepts in your own words:
- Aspect: An aspect is a module that encapsulates the cross-cutting concerns. In Spring AOP, aspects are classes annotated with @Aspect
```
@Aspect
public class LoggingAspect {
}
```
- PointCut: A pointcut is an expression that matches join points. It tells Spring AOP where to apply the advice.
```
@Pointcut("execution(* chuwa.*.*(..))")
public void serviceMethods() {}
```
- JoinPoint: A join point is a point during the execution of a program, such as a method call or an exception being thrown, where an aspect can be applied.
- Advice: An advice is the action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. There are different types of advice like @Before, @After, @Around.
```
@Before("execution(* chuwa.*.*(..))")
public void logBefore(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
    System.out.println("Executing method: " + joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
}

```


## 6. How do we declare a pointcut? Can we declare it without annotating an empty method? Name some expressions to do it.
```
@Pointcut("execution(* chuwa.*.*(..))")
public void serviceMethods() {}

```

- execution(): Matches method execution.
- within(): Limits the join points to a specific type.
- args(): Matches method arguments.


## 7. Compare different types of advices in Spring AOP.
- @Before: Runs before the method execution.
- @After: Runs after the method finishes (regardless of the outcome).
- @AfterReturning: Runs after the method successfully returns a value.
- @AfterThrowing: Runs if the method throws an exception.
- @Around: Runs before and after the method execution.
