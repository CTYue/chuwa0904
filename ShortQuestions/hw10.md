## HW 10

### Question 2
#### Tight coupling
* Tight coupling means two classes or components are heavily dependent on each other.
* In a tightly coupled system, changes in one class often necessitate changes in other classes, making the system harder to maintain and extend.
#### Loose Coupling
* Loose coupling means classes or components have minimal dependencies on each other.
* In Loose coupling, Components interact through well-defined interfaces or abstractions, allowing changes in one component without significantly affecting others.
  
### Question 3
MVC(Model–view–controller) pattern divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. Includes:
1. Model : Container for data, used to transfer data from one part of the Spring MVC application to another.
2. View : It receives the model containing data and reads the model and displays the data.
3. Controller: It is an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives input from the user (like clicks or form submissions) and processes it.

### Question 4
In MVC, a front controller handles all the user input or request and process. It process the data, store the data in a data structure(model) and send it to other controller or View Template.

### Question 5
The DispatcherServlet acts as the Front Controller in the MVC pattern. This is how it works:
1. Client Request: The client sends an HTTP request to the web application (e.g., by accessing a URL).

2. Request Intercepted by DispatcherServlet: The DispatcherServlet intercepts all incoming requests. It acts as the single entry point for the application, thanks to its configuration in the web application's deployment descriptor (web.xml) or programmatic configuration.
3.Handler Mapping:
    * The DispatcherServlet consults one or more Handler Mappings to determine which controller (or handler) is responsible for processing the incoming request.
    * This mapping is based on the URL or some other criteria (like annotations, request parameters, etc.).
4. Controller Execution:
    * Once a suitable controller is identified, the DispatcherServlet forwards the request to the appropriate Controller.
    * The controller processes the request, usually by interacting with the Model (data and business logic).
5. Model and View: After processing the request, the controller typically returns a ModelAndView object, which contains the data (Model) and the name of the view to be rendered.
6. View Resolution: The DispatcherServlet consults a View Resolver to determine how to render the view (e.g., as a JSP page, Thymeleaf template, or JSON response).
7. Rendering the View: The resolved view is then rendered by passing the model data to it. The view is then sent back as the HTTP response to the client.

### Question 6
JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a server-side technology used to create platform-independent web pages.
* Mixing Java and HTML: JSP allows developers to include Java code inside HTML tags using special tags like <% %>, making it easier to create dynamic content.
* Tag Libraries: JSP supports tag libraries like JSTL which provide ready-to-use tags to manage common tasks such as looping, conditional logic, and formatting.

### Question 7
A Servlet is a Java program used to handle HTTP requests and generate responses in a web application. 
A Servlet Container (Web Container) is a part of a web server or an application server that manages the lifecycle of servlets, handles HTTP requests and responses, and provides network services such as security, threading, and resource management.
