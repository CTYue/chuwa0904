// As a result, when we run this Spring Boot application, it will automatically scan the components in the current
// package and its sub-packages. Thus it will register them in Springâ€™s Application Context, and allow us to inject
// beans using @Autowired.

        // to achieve inversion of control.

        // The interfaces BeanFactory and ApplicationContext represent the Spring IoC container.
        // BeanFactory is the root interface for accessing the Spring container. It provides basic functionalities for managing beans.
        // On the other hand, the ApplicationContext is a sub-interface of the BeanFactory. Therefore, it offers all the
        // functionalities of BeanFactory.
        // Furthermore, it provides more enterprise-specific functionalities. The important features of ApplicationContext
        // are resolving messages, supporting internationalization, publishing events, and application-layer specific contexts.
